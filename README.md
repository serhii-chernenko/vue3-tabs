# Tabs Component Challenge

Your task is to create `VTabs` and `VTabPanel` components. They should be tightly coupled (ie, always used together).

## Requirements

1. You should not alter App.vue at all but implement your component based on the existing usage.
2. The interface should work like tabs typically do.
   1. it should display a clickable tab for each panel
   2. It should only display the panel content of the active tab

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: Feel free to use TypeScript to make your components type safe if you'd like. This is NOT required however.
